Beam.js is a modular JavaScript VM engine built on top of [erlv8](https://github.com/beamjs/erlv8/wiki) that connects two powerful languages â€” JavaScript and Erlang. With Beam.js JavaScript lovers can piggy back on Erlang's solid distributed networking infrastructure as well as other powerful components. For Erlang users, it can provide a powerful way to describe top level business logic on top
of their robust architectures. Possibilities are endless.
